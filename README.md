> Hi Philippe,

> I'm Huiwen the postdoc with Julien, I'm so happy that you can help us with
> this issue. The attachment is the information of stations that we are
> interested in, and here is the link of model we found: Arctic Ocean
> Biogeochemistry Analysis and Forecast | Copernicus Marine Service
>
> The ppt is the map visualized from the model above with python. We think the
> plastic concentartions may have some corelation with that of nutrients. This
> is why we want to extract data for specific coordinate/our stations for
> further analysis. Could you help us with that? Thank you in advance!!
